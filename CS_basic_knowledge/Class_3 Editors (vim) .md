In Vim, there are three modes of operation: Normal, Insert, and Visual.

Normal: Esc key

Insert: i

Visual: v

Insert mode is where you can insert your text in the file. This mode inserts every character you type at the current cursor location.

Visual mode allows you to select text so that you may perform certain operations (cut, copy, delete) on it.
